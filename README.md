# Knowledge base wiki

(C) 2026, Rijn Buve

This repository contains a solid implementation of [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki idea](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). It is an LLM-maintained knowledge base for work-related notes, structured as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, assisted by the semantic database [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd).

## Purpose

The primary goal is **efficient decision intelligence**: understanding why decisions were taken, on what basis, by whom, and when. Secondary goals include mapping how technologies and systems relate, who is involved in what, and how competitors compare. And 'efficient', because the mechanism needs to be token (and environmentally) efficient.

**Division of labor:** 
- The user curates source files in `raw/`.
- LLM does all writing, cross-referencing, and bookkeeping in `wiki/`. 

## In a nutshell

Access to the knowledge base is as follows:
- **create and collect notes** 
	- user produces raw notes and stores them in the `raw/notes` directory, or
	- user uses the Obsidian Web Clipper to store notes in `raw/clips`, or
	- user stores `.vtt` meeting transcripts in `raw/transcripts`, or
	- user drags `.eml` emails to `raw/emails`, or
	- user stored handwritten notes or scanned pages (PDF, JPG) in `raw/scans`
- **ingest notes**
	- user asks to "ingest new raw notes" or "ingest Confluence page `<URL>`"
	- LLM converts non-Markdown inputs: `.vtt` transcripts → `raw/transcripts/converted/`, `.eml` emails → `raw/emails/converted/`, `.pdf/.jpg` scans → `raw/scans/converted/`
	- LLM partitions files into batches and processes them (large ingests use parallel LLM sessions 2–5; single batches are handled in one session)
	- After all batches are done, user says "finalize ingest" to merge session logs, rebuild `_index.md` files, and run post-processing (QMD re-index + health check)
- **query wiki**
	- user asks a high-level question
	- LLM queries semantic database (with the `qmd` skill) for relevant page links (fast/token-efficient)
	- LLM processes suggested pages and produces answer to user
	- LLM stores valuable conversations in `wiki/conversations/` to extend the knowledge base

The combination of using a semantic database to fetch relevant pages before analyzing documents and reasoning about them, makes this implementation of a knowledge significantly faster and more token efficient than when it's using Markdown files only.

## Commands and skills

These skills commands and natural-language triggers are available:

| Command / phrase          | Description |
| ----------------          | ----------- |
| "ingest new notes:"       | Start a new ingest of raw notes (Session 1 — coordinator flow) |
| "ingest next batch"       | Continue ingesting the next batch (Sessions 2–N flow) |
| "finalize ingest"         | Finalize the ingest: merge logs, rebuild indexes, run post-processing |
| "health check" or "lint"  | Check for orphaned pages, broken links, contradictions |
| "add missing [topic]"     | Create a new wiki page for a missing concept, person, system, etc. |
| "clear ingest batches"    | Remove incomplete batch files to restart a failed ingest |
| ask any question          | Query the knowledge base (default behavior) |

The `ingest next batch` and `finalize ingest` commands are only needed for importing large amounts of notes. LLM will notify you when you `ingest new notes` and it sees it requires batched importing.

### Pro-tip: use `wiki-ingest-loop.sh` to ingest multiple files

You can use the script "scripts/wiki-ingest-loop.sh" to start ingesting new notes. The advantage of this script is that it will try to ingest new notes in batches, and wait if your 5h limit has been reached. It will first execute "ingest new notes" followed by as many "ingest next batch" prompts as necessary (up to a specified maximum). Use "--help" for help for this script.

You start it for a specific agent (Claude CLI or Junie CLI), like this
```
scripts/wiki-ingest.loop.sh [--agent claude|junie]    
```

Use `wiki-ingest.loop.sh --help` for more options.


## Getting started

This knowledge base setup uses a combination of Obsidian (front-end), LLM and QMD (database) to create that knowledge base. It consists of:

- a `raw` directory, which is my territory: I put all my notes there; AI can only read this, not write
- a `wiki` directory, which is consolidated information about the raw notes; this is almost exclusively AI territory

After putting all your notes in the raw directories, the magic words for LLM are: “ingest new raw notes”. That will create the wiki and update the semantic database (QMD). After that you can ask all sorts of questions to LLM and it can efficiently reason over 100s or 1000s of pages (I’m using 2700 pages now and it seems to work just fine).

The keyword here is AI efficiency: if you have 10s of notes, you don’t need any of this. If you have 100s, you’re already burning tokens. If you have 1000s of notes, LLM won’t handle this well without a semantic database backing the search.

The directory is readable as an Obsidian vault. This is on purpose. Obsidian makes it really easy to add Markdown notes and read them, or do simple searches. You can use a LLM CLI next to it to query the same directory. Alternatively, you can run the whole thing in VS Code. 

I’ve tried to make this pretty user-friendly, so putting stuff in the ‘raw’ directory is as easy as:
- using Obsidian to create Markdown notes, and storing PDF or JPG attachments in the ‘\_resources’ directory (LLM will parse those and recognize handwriting and convert those to Markdown as well)
- using the Obsidian Web Clipper to automatically clip articles to ‘raw/clips’ (clipper template provided in repo); this means it’s just one Shift-Cmd-O press to store an article in the right location
- using drag-and-drop from Outlook to the ‘raw/emails’ directory to store ‘.eml’ files (LLM will use the provided conversion script to create perfect Markdowns of these); putting an alias to the email directory on your desktop makes it easy to find that directory for drag-and-drop 😊 
- storing meeting transcripts (‘.vtt’) in ‘raw/transcripts’ (LLM will convert those to Markdown as well)

### Personalizing your setup

You can provide personal info on who you are, what you do and what your focus is, in `config/personal_info.md`. This could be something like this:

```
# Personal Info
My name is ...
I am ...

# My Main Focus
- Strategic decision making on technology choices.
- ...
```

If the file is missing, or it contains no info topics, default topics will be used.

### Re-creating the Wiki from Scratch

To re-create the entire wiki, you can simply remove the `wiki/` directory, `/clear` the LLM conversations and ask it to `ingest new raw notes`. This will restart the entire ingestion process. Note that for large amounts of notes, this may be expensive and take a long time.

### Checking Your Database

The database is automatically checked for errors after ingesting new notes, but sometimes the errors cannot be fixed automatically. You are advised to sometimes run:
```
./scripts/wiki-lint-check.py --format text
```
This checks the consistency of your entire database. If you encounter problems, you can run:
```
./scripts/wiki-lint-check.py --interactive
```
This provides a UI to deal with broken links by
- removing them, 
- simply marking them as broken, or 
- allowing you to search for the proper target link in `raw` and `wiki` and replacing it with that.
Try it out. It's quite user-friendly.

## Installation

### Obsidian

Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (free, Mac/Windows/Linux). Open this directory as a vault: **Open folder as vault** → select the repo root. Obsidian reads the `wiki/` pages with wikilink navigation, graph view, and backlinks out of the box — no plugins required for basic use.

For web clipping, install the [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) browser extension and import `obsidian_webclipper_template.json` from this repo as a clipper template.

### QMD

QMD is the local semantic search engine that lets LLM query thousands of notes efficiently without reading every file.

Install via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install qmd
```

Register all `raw/` and `wiki/` subdirectories as QMD collections:

```sh
./scripts/qmd-sync-collections.sh
```

Then build the index (this can take a while!):

```sh
qmd update && qmd embed   
```

Register QMD as a MCP server (simply ask LLM to read this `README.md` and install it for you):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qmd": {
      "command": "qmd",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Installing the LLM skill isn't needed - it's part of this repo. But if you want to do it manually (again):
```sh
qmd skill install --global --yes   # or omit --global if you want it local-omly
```
Re-run `qmd update` (and `qmd embed`) after each ingest to keep the index current. LLM will prompt you to do this at the end of every ingest.

### Running Claude within Obsidian

You can run Claude from within Obsidian using the Claudian plugin. Install the plugin simply by asking Claude to do so with the following prompt:
```
Claude, I want you to install the following Obsidian plugin from Github. First, I want you to review ihe plugin
and make sure it is safe to install. And if it is safe, install it. This is the repo: https://github.com/YishenTu/claudian
```

The directories `raw` and `wiki` are not stored in Git. Create them manually before first use.

## Wiki topic types

| Type              | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **competition**   | Competing companies, products, and approaches              |
| **concepts**      | Technologies, standards, mental models, domain vocabulary  |
| **conversations** | Valuable results of earlier queries/conversations          |
| **decisions**     | Why decisions were taken, on what basis, by whom, and when |
| **people**        | Colleagues, contacts, external stakeholders, teams         |
| **problems**      | Active and past problems                                   |
| **projects**      | Active and past initiatives                                |
| **systems**       | System, products, platforms, and services                  |

## Key rules

- `raw/` is immutable — LLM never writes there (except `raw/confluence/` as a fetch cache).
- `wiki/` is LLM-owned — LLM writes, the user reads.
- The relevant `wiki/<type>/_index.md` files are rebuilt and `wiki/log.jsonl` is updated on every finalized ingest.
- Hand-curated content in wiki pages is never deleted or overwritten.
