# Knowledge Base - Health Check

## Step 1: Broken link check (automatic)

Run this command first — it auto-fixes trivial wikilink mismatches and reports what remains broken:

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-wiki-pages.py --fix
```

- `--fix` repairs wikilinks where a unique normalized match exists (e.g. colons vs underscores in filenames). These are applied immediately without requiring user confirmation.
- Report how many links were fixed, and list any remaining broken links for the user to review manually.
- If there are problems left, suggest the user to run:
```bash
python3 scripts/lint-wiki-pages.py --interactive
```

## Step 2: Report stubs

Use this command to scan markdown files for stubs:
```bash
find wiki -name "*.md" -exec awk '/^---/{p++} p==1{print FILENAME": "$0} p==2{p=0; nextfile}' {} + | grep "stub:.*true"
```
If any exist, list them in a "Stubs that still needing expansion" section so the user knows what gaps remain.

## Step 3: Report known contradcitions

Use this command to scan markdown files for known contradictions:
```bash
find wiki -name "*.md" -exec awk '/^---/{p++} p==1{print FILENAME": "$0} p==2{p=0; nextfile}' {} + | grep "contradiction:.*true"
```
If any exist, list them in a "Contradictions that still need resolution" section so the user knows what gaps remain.

## Step 4: Manual checks

Present recommendations only — never modify the wiki for these without user confirmation.

- **Missing top-level topics** — if 10+ pages relate to a common concept not listed as a top-level topic in `wiki/index.md`, suggest adding it.
- **Data gaps** — suggest new sources worth finding.
- **Missing dedicated pages** — topics mentioned across multiple pages that lack their own page; do not suggest-top-level topics, but pages within the top-level topics only.
