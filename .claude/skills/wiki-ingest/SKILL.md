# Knowledge Base - Ingest

## Session 1 — coordinator

When asked to "ingest new raw notes" (or similar):

1. **Convert raw files** (run automatically before partitioning):
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/convert-vtt-to-md.py --input-dir raw/transcripts --output-dir raw/transcripts/converted
   python3 scripts/convert-eml-to-md.py --input-dir raw/emails --output-dir raw/emails/converted
   ```
   These convert VTT transcript files and EML email files into markdown so they are picked up by the batch importer. Skip silently if the input directories don't exist.
2. **Partition** (run automatically): `bash scripts/wiki-create-import-batches.sh`
   - Default max batch size is 50 files. Override with `--max-size N` (e.g. `--max-size 20`).
   - This removes any old `.import/batch-import-*.txt` remnants and creates fresh ones.
   - **If the script exits with code 3**: there are no new notes to ingest. Report "Nothing to ingest" and stop.
   - **If the script exits with code 2**: a previous ingest was not completed. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user what to do, with these options:
     - **"Ingest next batch"** — stop here and tell the user: "Use `wiki-ingest-next-batch` (or say `ingest next batch`) in a new session to continue."; do NOT re-run `wiki-create-import-batches.sh`.
     - **"Abort previous ingestion and restart importing new notes"** — re-run `bash scripts/wiki-create-import-batches.sh --force` to wipe old batches, then continue with this flow from step 3.
     - **"Abort"** — stop immediately and do nothing.
   - Check the exit code explicitly after running the script: `bash scripts/wiki-create-import-batches.sh; echo "EXIT:$?"` and look for `EXIT:2` or `EXIT:3`.
3. **Check how many batches have content**: count non-empty `.import/batch-import-*.txt` files (the script prints the count).
   - **If only 1 batch has content**: process it (step 4) and immediately proceed to Finalization — say "Batch done. Say `finalize ingest` (or `/wiki-finalize-ingest`) to wrap up."
   - **If 2+ batches have content**: instruct the user — "Batches ready. Open N more LLM sessions. In each one say: `ingest next batch` (or `/wiki-ingest-next-batch`). I'll start batch 1 now. When all sessions are done, say `finalize ingest` (or `/wiki-finalize-ingest`) here." — then proceed to step 4.
4. **Process batch 1**: first claim it atomically:
   ```bash
   mv .import/batch-import-1.txt .import/batch-import-1.claimed.txt
   ```
   Then read `.import/batch-import-1.claimed.txt`. Dispatch sub-agents in batches of 10 to process the files.
   Each sub-agent prompt must begin with: 
     "Invoke `wiki-ingest-per-note` before processing. Write session logs to `.import/batch-log-1.jsonl`. Then ingest these files: [list]."
   After all sub-agents finish, delete `.import/batch-import-1.claimed.txt`.
5. **If single-batch**: tell the user to run `finalize ingest`. **If multi-batch**: report notes processed/pages created/updated, then await "finalize ingest".

## Confluence ingestion

Triggered by a Confluence URL or page title:

- Fetch via `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__fetch`
- Save to `raw/confluence/<Page Title>.md` with frontmatter:
```yaml
---
source_url: <url>
fetched: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
---
```
- Continue with per-note ingestion for that file (as a single-file session — write to `.import/batch-log-1.jsonl`, then immediately tell the user to run `finalize ingest`).

**Refresh:** "refresh this Confluence page" → re-fetch, overwrite cache, diff vs previous, flag changes affecting existing wiki pages.

## wiki/log.jsonl format

`wiki/log.jsonl` is append-only. One JSON object per line, sorted oldest-to-newest by append order.

```jsonl
{"date":"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss","session":1,"file":"raw/notes/meeting-2026-03-01.md","summary":"Quarterly planning meeting notes.","pages_created":["wiki/decisions/adopt-vector-tiles.md","wiki/projects/AutoStream.md"],"pages_updated":["wiki/people/Jane Smith.md"]}
```

Finding un-ingested notes: `jq -r '.file' wiki/log.jsonl` — lists all ingested paths.  
Fallback without jq: `grep -oP '"file":"\K[^"]+' wiki/log.jsonl`

## Notes

- A single note may touch 5–25+ wiki pages. That is expected and desirable.
- Never re-ingest a file already present in `wiki/log.jsonl` without explicit user confirmation.
- Parallel sessions writing to the same wiki page is safe: the second session reads the already-updated page and extends it further.
